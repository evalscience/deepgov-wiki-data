The Rural Solar Electrification Network aims to bridge the energy gap in off-grid communities through sustainable solar solutions.

## Project Scope

Nearly 800 million people worldwide lack access to electricity. This project targets remote villages in Sub-Saharan Africa to establish community-owned solar microgrids that provide reliable, clean energy, following best practices outlined in recent research on renewable energy solutions for rural electrification [@irena_rural_electrification].

## Technical Approach

Our solar microgrid system includes:

- Photovoltaic panel arrays
- Battery storage systems
- Microgrid distribution networks
- Smart metering and payment systems
- Remote monitoring capabilities

## Implementation Model

The project follows a community-based implementation model:

- Local cooperative ownership
- Pay-as-you-go billing systems
- Technical training for local maintenance teams
- Entrepreneurship support for productive energy use
- Cross-subsidization for public services (schools, clinics)
