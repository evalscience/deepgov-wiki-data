<div class="project-content">
  <p>The Rural Solar Electrification Network aims to bridge the energy gap in off-grid communities through sustainable solar solutions.</p>

  <h2>Project Scope</h2>

  <p>Nearly 800 million people worldwide lack access to electricity. This project targets remote villages in Sub-Saharan Africa to establish community-owned solar microgrids that provide reliable, clean energy.</p>

  <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

  <p>Our solar microgrid system includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Photovoltaic panel arrays</li>
    <li>Battery storage systems</li>
    <li>Microgrid distribution networks</li>
    <li>Smart metering and payment systems</li>
    <li>Remote monitoring capabilities</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Implementation Model</h2>

  <p>The project follows a community-based implementation model:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Local cooperative ownership</li>
    <li>Pay-as-you-go billing systems</li>
    <li>Technical training for local maintenance teams</li>
    <li>Entrepreneurship support for productive energy use</li>
    <li>Cross-subsidization for public services (schools, clinics)</li>
  </ul>
