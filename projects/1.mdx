The Clean Water Access Initiative aims to address the critical need for safe, accessible drinking water in remote communities across East Africa.

## Project Overview

Over 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services [@who_water_quality]. Our initiative focuses on implementing sustainable water solutions through a combination of well-drilling, rainwater harvesting systems, and community-managed water treatment facilities, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6 targets for clean water and sanitation [@un_sdg6].

## Core Components

The project includes several key components:

- Deep-well drilling in strategic locations
- Installation of solar-powered pumping systems
- Construction of community water points
- Training of local water committees
- Implementation of water quality monitoring systems

## Community Engagement

Local community engagement is essential for the long-term success of the project. We work directly with village leaders and establish water management committees that are trained in:

- Basic maintenance of water systems
- Water quality testing
- Fee collection for sustainability
- Hygiene education and promotion
- Conflict resolution for resource sharing
