<div class="project-content">
  <p>The Clean Water Access Initiative aims to address the critical need for safe, accessible drinking water in remote communities across East Africa.</p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>Over 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services. Our initiative focuses on implementing sustainable water solutions through a combination of well-drilling, rainwater harvesting systems, and community-managed water treatment facilities.</p>

  <h2>Core Components</h2>

  <p>The project includes several key components:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Deep-well drilling in strategic locations</li>
    <li>Installation of solar-powered pumping systems</li>
    <li>Construction of community water points</li>
    <li>Training of local water committees</li>
    <li>Implementation of water quality monitoring systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Community Engagement</h2>

  <p>Local community engagement is essential for the long-term success of the project. We work directly with village leaders and establish water management committees that are trained in:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Basic maintenance of water systems</li>
    <li>Water quality testing</li>
    <li>Fee collection for sustainability</li>
    <li>Hygiene education and promotion</li>
    <li>Conflict resolution for resource sharing</li>
  </ul>
