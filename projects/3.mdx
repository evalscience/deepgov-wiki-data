The Open Source Digital Public Goods Platform is a global initiative to create and maintain high-quality, open-source digital public goods that address critical societal challenges.

## Project Scope

In an increasingly digital world, many public services still rely on proprietary solutions that limit accessibility and innovation. This project establishes a collaborative platform for developing, maintaining, and deploying open-source digital public goods, following the principles outlined in the Digital Public Goods Standard [@dpg_standard].

## Technical Approach

Our platform includes:

- Open-source code repositories with permissive licenses
- Comprehensive documentation and developer guides
- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Security and accessibility auditing tools
- Community contribution workflows
- Interoperability standards and APIs

## Implementation Model

The project operates on an open governance model:

- Community-driven development
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Merit-based contribution system
- Regular security audits and updates
- Global network of maintainers and contributors
- Focus on digital sovereignty and data protection

## Impact and Benefits

- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces software licensing costs for public institutions
- **Innovation**: Enables rapid iteration and improvement through community contributions
- **Transparency**: Open codebase allows for public scrutiny and trust
- **Localization**: Easy adaptation to local needs and languages
- **Sustainability**: Community ownership ensures long-term maintenance
